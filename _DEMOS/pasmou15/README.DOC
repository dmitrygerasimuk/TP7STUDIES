  What is PASCAL MOUSE ?
  ======================

  PASCAL MOUSE was born when I had to write a PASCAL program that used
  the mouse. I started to look for a good mouse interface for PASCAL.
  I was not very satisfied with what I found (some units didn't have all
  the routines I needed, or they didn't include their full source, or they
  were very slow or difficult to use). Fortunately I found a fine mouse
  documentation (from Ralf Brown's INTERRUPT LIST). I decided to write
  my own mouse interface for PASCAL.

  PASCAL MOUSE provides an easy-to-use mouse interface for programs written
  in Turbo/Borland Pascal version 6.0/7.0. It contains 55 procedures and
  functions that interface almost all the standard functions of a Microsoft
  compatible mouse driver. All the normal mouse routines are contained (reset
  mouse, show, hide, read position and button state, change cursor shape,
  define sensitivity and threshold, set cursor range, get mouse driver
  information, support for user interrupt handlers, etc.).

  PASCAL MOUSE is written using the Borland Pascal built-in assembler for
  speed and small size. Full source code is included.

  A comprehensive programming manual (MANUAL.DOC) and demo programs are
  included.


  What's new in version 1.5 ?
  ===========================

  9 procedures and functions were added (support for user interrupt handlers,
  routines to enable/disable the mouse driver, a routine to change the mouse
  interrupt rate).

  A new example program is included. It demonstrates how to change the mouse
  cursor shape in graphic modes.

  The documentation has been rewritten and improved.

  PASCAL MOUSE now supports Turbo/Borland Pascal 6.0 and 7.0.

  The more feedback I get the more likely I am to continue improving PASCAL
  MOUSE and writing other freeware programming libraries.
